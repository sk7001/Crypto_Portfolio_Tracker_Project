# 🪙 Crypto Portfolio Tracker (Spring Boot Backend)

A backend service to help users manage and monitor their cryptocurrency portfolios. Users can track holdings, monitor real-time/simulated crypto prices, and receive alerts based on price thresholds.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

Build a secure and efficient platform that enables users to:

- Track their crypto asset holdings.
- View current asset values.
- Set and manage price alerts.
- Simulate or fetch real-time crypto price updates.

---

## 🧩 Core Functional Features

### 1. 👤 User Management

- User Registration and Login.
- Secure password encryption (BCrypt).
- Basic role setup (e.g., USER, ADMIN).


---

### 2. 💼 Portfolio Management

- Users can manage their portfolio with crypto assets.
- Each asset includes:
  - `coinName`, `symbol`, `quantityHeld`, `buyPrice`, `buyDate`.

**Supported Actions:**

- Add crypto asset to portfolio.
- View user's portfolio.
- Update quantity or buy price.
- Delete an asset.

---

### 3. 📈 Price Tracking & Valuation

- Simulates prices for popular coins like BTC, ETH, SOL, ADA.
- Calculates:
  - `currentValue = quantityHeld * currentPrice`
  - `PnL (Profit/Loss) = currentValue - (quantityHeld * buyPrice)`

> Optionally, you may integrate a third-party API like CoinGecko.

---

### 4. 🚨 Alerts Management

- Users can create alerts per coin (e.g., Alert when BTC < $30,000).
- A scheduler runs in the background every 30s–1min.
- Alerts are stored in the database when triggered.
